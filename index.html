      <h1 class="hello">Hello, Im Nick. A Creative From Springfield, Mo.</h1>

      <p>My love for technology started at a very young age with video games and taking apart old consoles and trying to put them back together. Fast forward about 10 or so years, a close friend of mine told me about this social network called
        Myspace and told me to make one, without any hesitation, i did. None of us had any idea what we were doing and our sites were very bland and stock. After looking at other profiles and and copying and pasting layouts, we all looked the same
        and there was no real originality and flair. thats when it all started.. ...staying up long hours just to get a logo where my name was, hiding the comment section, making my profile picture turn black and white over hover, i was absolutely
        hooked on to html and css. I would start doing other peoples profiles and it hit me: this could really be my future. Fast forward about 10 more years and here we are today. 25 years old in the beautiful ozark mountains with the same passion
        for development like i did when i was younger. Outside of Technology, some of my passions include: Mountain biking, Rock climbing, the outdoors, Fashion, Music, Art, Liturature, and Learning new things constantly to apply in real world
        situations.
